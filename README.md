Hi, I’m Alyssa.
I’m interested in new opportunities around Cloud Computing ☁️, ML/AI 🤖, Apple Apps, React, DevOps level stuff...
I’m currently slowly 😜 learning Swift and React

I focus my free time on my family, biking, backpacking, LGBTQ+ inclusiveness, thinking compassionately, and being a better parent.
